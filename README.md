# Automate-Your-Day-Job-with-Python

Welcome to the world of programming with Python. In this project, we'll be using very basic concepts of Python in finance. 

## Methods and Techniques Used:

This project will be using python techniques which includes retrieving number of rows in dataset, calculating the total amount of Profit/Losses over a given period, looping through the rows in a provided dataset, calculating the change of value through the given months in our data.

## The Goal of this Project:

The goal is to be able to determine which month had the greatest increase in profits, which month had the greatest decrease in profits and calculate the total average change of profits/losses over provided period when the data is given.
